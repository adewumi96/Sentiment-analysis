# Sentiment-analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to explore the TED Talks dataset and gain insights into the talks given by two specific speakers: Nina Tandon who is a biomedical engineer,she is also the CEO and Co-Founder of Epi-Bone and Erik Brynjolfsson is an American academic, inventor and author.
Nina Tandon’s presentation titled “Caring for engineered tissue” was posted in 2011 while Erik brynjolfsson’s presentation titled “The key to growth?Race with machines” was posted in 2013. In this report, I will use various text analysis techniques for data exploration and result visualization to provide insight into the lexical choices of these speakers and the association between sentiment and the speaker’s talk.

To achieve this, I will use R and several R libraries such as dsEssex, tidy text, ggplot2, dplyr, and ggrepel. I will begin by loading and cleaning the dataset, tokenizing and removing stop words. Next, I will create visualizations of the most common words used by each speaker and their sentiment, and explore the relationship between sentiment and the speaker’s talk.

The findings of this analysis will provide insight into the communication styles and topics of Nina Tandon and Erik Brynjolfsson, and will contribute to a better understanding of the TED Talks dataset.
